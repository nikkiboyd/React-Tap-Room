# Tap Room | React Edition
### Refactoring an Angular application into React
#### _Nikki Boyd | September 7, 2018_
#### _React Independent Project | Week 1_


# _About the App_
This application showcases my foundational knowledge of React after week one. This project gave me experience setting up a work environment (including Babel transpiling, Webpack module bundling, a development server with hot module replacement, and linting), building out UI components, styling with React's unique inline CSS styles, and iterating through JSON data.

Below is a screenshot of the project after phase one:
